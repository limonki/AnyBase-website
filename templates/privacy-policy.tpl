    <h1 class="title-1">PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p class="anim">Effective date: September 18, 2018</p>
    <p class="anim">AnyBase ("us", "we", or "our") operates the http://www.anybase.cba.pl/ website (the "Service") and other freely widespread websites by anyone who created his own database using AnyBase.</p>
    <p class="anim">At the time of product installation, the user becomes the administrator and manager of the database.</p>
    <p class="anim">The way in which data is processed in the use of the Services offered by the product is the same for all installations carried out on any server. Due to the possibility of a data leak occurance (deliberate or not) caused by the administrator / moderator or other third parties, the obligation to protect data rests with each administrator and moderator in every other scope than the AnyBase privacy policy predicts. Administrators and moderators are required to comply with the privacy policy, to manage and process data in a manner consistent with document  below.</p>
    <p class="anim">Responsibility for data leaks caused by users ("administrators", "moderators", "third parties") that are not causally linked to the handling of data by the product is excluded from the liability of the producer providing the product. In all other cases, the law generally applicable in a given country / region applies.</p>
    <p class="anim">This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>
    <p class="anim">We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.</p>
    <h2 class="anim title-2">DATA ADMINISTRATOR</h2>
    <p class="anim">The administrator of your data is the user who installed and created a copy of the product. It has the data protection obligations set out in the following document. The producer excludes its liability for the leakage of personal data caused by a different event than an event related to the handling and processing of data within the product.</p>
    <h2 class="anim title-2">INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h2>
    <p class="anim">We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.</p>
    <h3 class="anim title-3">Types of Data Collected</h3>
    <h4 class="anim title-3">Personal Data</h4>
    <p class="anim">While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul class="anim">
      <li>Email address</li><li>Username and password</li><li>First name and last name</li><li>Cookies and Usage Data</li><li>Personal Biogram</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="anim title-3">Usage Data</h4>
    <p class="anim">We may also collect information how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.</p>
    <h4 class="anim title-3">Tracking & Cookies Data</h4>
    <p class="anim">We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and hold certain information.</p>
    <p class="anim">Cookies are files with small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device. Tracking technologies also used are beacons, tags, and scripts to collect and track information and to improve and analyze our Service.</p>
    <p class="anim">You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.</p>
    <p class="anim">Examples of Cookies we use:</p>
    <ul class="anim">
        <li><strong>Session Cookies.</strong> We use Session Cookies to operate our Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Preference Cookies.</strong> We use Preference Cookies to remember your preferences and various settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Cookies.</strong> We use Security Cookies for security purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="anim title-2">OTHER DATA GATHERING TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
    <p class="anim">For the convenience of using our Services, we use Local Storage (LS) technology, similar to the principle of operation for cookies, but having slightly different properties. LS is a separate part of browser memory used to store data saved by websites. Access to it can only be obtained from a website operating on the same website from which the data was saved, but unlike cookies, they are not sent by the browser every time you refer to the server. The data in LS is permanently stored by the browser and is not deleted when the browser is closed or has a validity period. We emphasize that we do not use this technology to "track" or identify users, but only for convenience and to provide Services at the highest level. We use LS technology, for example to remember settings, preserve the radio configuration or store data about recommended entries.</p>
    <h2 class="anim title-2">WHAT DATA ARE WE PROCESSING?</h2>
    <p class="anim">We process data that you provide or leave as part of the use of Services.
